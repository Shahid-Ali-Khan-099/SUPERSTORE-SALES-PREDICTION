# Superstore-Sales-Prediction


Developed a machine learning model to predict sales in a superstore based on historical data. 

Explored various regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to identify the most suitable approach for sales prediction.

Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to ensure accuracy and reliability in predicting sales figures.
